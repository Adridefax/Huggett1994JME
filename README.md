# Huggett1994JME
 This code solves a general equilibrium heterogeneous agents life cycle model (in progress).
 At the moment, the unique Julia script includes the following:
 1. Functions that solve a finite-horizon household consumption-savings problem, both with bisection and EGM.
 2. A function that simulates the entire path of asset holdings, earnings and consumption given policy functions.
 3. A function that finds the equilibrium bequest for any interest rate via bisection.
 4. A function that finds the interest rate consistent with general equilibrium.
